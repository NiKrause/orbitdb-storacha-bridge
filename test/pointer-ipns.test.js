/**
 * @fileoverview A pointer a second device can find with nothing but a key.
 *
 * The routing endpoint here is a few lines of `node:http` in this file, so the
 * suite needs no network and no third party. What it cannot test is the part
 * that is somebody else's: whether a public endpoint takes a record, keeps it,
 * and hands it back. That was measured separately
 * (`test/helpers/probe-ipns-routing.js`), and the module's own doc comment says
 * what the measurement did and did not establish.
