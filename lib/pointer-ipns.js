/**
 * A pointer a second device can find with nothing but a key.
 *
 * The problem this solves is not storage — a backup's CID is enough to fetch
 * it from anywhere — but *naming*: a device that has lost everything cannot be
 * told a CID, because there is nobody left to tell it. So the name has to be
 * computable from the one thing that survived. Derive a key from a seed, and
 * the IPNS name follows from the key; two devices holding the same seed
 * compute the same name without ever exchanging anything.
 *
 * The seed is the caller's business. A passkey's PRF output is the case this
 * was written for (funkpost#93), and it never passes through here as anything
 * but bytes to stretch.
 *
 * Publication goes over **delegated routing** — `PUT /routing/v1/ipns/{name}`
 * — because a browser cannot join the DHT, and `w3name`, which used to stand
 * in for this, was Storacha's and Storacha is gone. Measured against
 * `delegated-ipfs.dev` on 2026-09-19, from Node and from a page on a foreign
 * origin: the preflight allows `PUT` from anywhere, the PUT is accepted, and
 * the GET returns the record byte for byte
 * (`test/helpers/probe-ipns-routing.js`).
 *
 * Two things that probe could not establish, and this module therefore does
 * not promise: that a record travels beyond the endpoint that accepted it, and
 * how long it is kept. Publish to more than one endpoint where that matters,
 * and treat a pointer as a shortcut for a device that comes back soon rather
 * than as an archive.
