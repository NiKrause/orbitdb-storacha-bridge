## What we want to accomplish

Alice and Bob are working with the same OrbitDB in a local-first, peer-to-peer web or mobile application.
In theory, in a perfect world, Alice and Bob would not need additional decentralized storage on Filecoin, since their data is already distributed among a number of peers. If Alice loses her data, Bob would still have a copy, and Alice could resync from Bob at any time (this reflects the current state of technology in OrbitDB). Additionally, relay nodes can optionally run Helia and OrbitDB instances for pinning the data of Alice and Bob in a decentralized way.

Storacha backup and restore (via the orbitdb-storacha-bridge) is intended for archiving large OrbitDBs, which take a long time to replicate. It is also useful for emergency cases, for example, when both Alice and Bob lose their data or devices. In that case, a new Alice, Bob, or even Peter can restore the work from Storacha. We support UCAN delegation here, so Alice can delegate access to the same Storacha backup space whoever she wants.

It has happened in the past that countries, mobile networks, internet providers, corporate networks, or hotels block IP addresses, ports, and protocols â€” for example, WebRTC or WebSocket/WebTransport gateways. Although libp2p supports many different transport options as backups and such cases are becoming rarer, it would still be desirable to have an additional option. This would allow users to restore an OrbitDB directly from IPFS and to push or upload database states back to it via Storacha/Filecoin after every change. This backup option becomes particularly valuable when peer-to-peer connectivity cannot be established due to network restrictions or when internet standards are broken.

Please note: Storacha backup and restore currently works via a centralized gateway to Filecoinâ€™s decentralized storage.

## What This Does

Backup and restore between **OrbitDB databases** and **Storacha/Filecoin** with or without full hash and identity preservation (both valid approaches). Works in both Node.js and browser environments (in browsers at this time only without the full hash identity preservation by restoring db entries only [Issue #4](../../issues/4))

Furthermore, a [`StorachaTest.svelte`](src/components/StorachaTest.svelte) and a [`StorachaAuth.svelte`](src/components/StorachaAuth.svelte) which demonstrate a typical basic OrbitDB Todo example workflow between two OrbitDB instances (with two separate libp2p, IPFS nodes running in the browser - Alice & Bob) in this basic scenario their nodes aren't connected, they exchange data simply to and from the Storacha gateway to Filecoin decentralized storage.

The [`scripts/svelte-backup-restore.js`](scripts/svelte-backup-restore.js) script is setting up a complete example Svelte App with StorachaTest.svelte and StorachaAuth.svelte - which is already uploaded here: [https://w3s.link/ipfs/bafybeic7xjxp6acm5hsj2eybtan3bomlkxzw74giicrm2aglh224rrjpkm](https://w3s.link/ipfs/bafybeic7xjxp6acm5hsj2eybtan3bomlkxzw74giicrm2aglh224rrjpkm)

Additionally exists a [`StorachaIntegration.svelte`](src/components/StorachaIntegration.svelte) which authenticates with Storacha, creates backups and restores for any OrbitDB Svelte app. (but has the above stated 'issue'). Since this isn't always an issue, StorachaTest.svelte is demonstrating a different approach when dealing with the entries in the oplog only and recreating/restoring the OrbitDB by adding a dbconfig object separately. This way the exact same db can be restored.

Implemented but untested: 
  - UCAN authentication (instead of Storacha key and proof credentials) and 
  - StorachaStorage (a OrbitDB CustomStorage) where it will be possible to reactively store an orbitdb live on Storacha as a permanent backup while other peers are replicating as normal.

## RoadMap

- [x] backup/restore between OrbitDB and Storacha in NodeJS via Storacha key and proof credential (hash and identity preserving)
- [ ] backup/restore between OrbitDB and Storacha in browser (StorachaIntegration.svelte) (hash and identity preserving) - [Issue #4](../../issues/4)
- [x] backup/restore between OrbitDB and Storacha in browser ([`StorachaTest.svelte`](src/components/StorachaTest.svelte)) (entries only - without manifest and identity preservation into new OrbitDB)
  - [x] using Storacha Credentials by [`StorachaAuth.svelte`](src/components/StorachaAuth.svelte)
  - [x] using UCAN + privatekey 
- [x] OrbitDB CAR file storage (OrbitDB CustomStorage)
- [?] backup/restore between OrbitDB and Storacha in NodeJS via UCAN and privatekey (hash and identity preserving)
- [ ] CustomStorage - implement OrbitDB StorachaStorage (OrbitDB CustomStorage) in NodeJS - storage ok - but OrbitDB CustomStore doesn't support accessing the Manifest. Initial-sync therefore difficult but manageable by a standard restore of the orbitdb-storacha-bridge function!
- [ ] OrbitDB Storacha storage (OrbitDB CustomStorage) in NodeJS (entries only - initial sync)

> **Note:** Currently, each Storacha space contains one full backup. For multiple backups, use separate spaces.

## Installation

Install the package via npm.

## Environment Setup

Get Storacha credentials from [storacha.network quickstart](https://docs.storacha.network/quickstart/), install w3 for the console, get storacha key and proof then set up your environment variables (.env) for STORACHA_KEY and STORACHA_PROOF.

## Demo

### NodeJS Demo Scripts (full backup with Manifest, Identity and AccessController and entries blocks)

- `node` [`examples/demo.js`](examples/demo.js) - Complete backup/restore cycle
- `node` [`examples/backup-demo.js`](examples/backup-demo.js) - Backup demonstration only  
- `node` [`examples/restore-demo.js`](examples/restore-demo.js) - Restore demonstration only

### Storacha Svelte Components

- [`StorachaAuth.svelte`](src/components/StorachaAuth.svelte) 
    Use this component when authenticating against Storacha with three different authentication methods: 
    1. Storacha credentials (Storacha-Key and Storacha Proof)
    2. UCAN (a UCAN which was delegated from another Storacha DID) + a corresponding private key
    3. Email (create a new Storacha account and space by email confirmation)

- [`StorachaTest.svelte`](src/components/StorachaTest.svelte)
    Use this component to demonstrate a collaboration between Alice & Bob both working with independent OrbitDB todo db's.
    Alice creates an OrbitDB and a DID from a generated mnemonic seed, creates todo items and creates a backup to Storacha by extracting the entries from IPFS storage and uploading them to Storacha.
    Bob creates another OrbitDB with the same or a new seed, connects to the same Storacha space as Alice and restores the Todo Items in his own OrbitDB.

    Remark: Alice & Bob's OrbitDB's in this scenario are independent db's with two different OrbitDB addresses and therefore cannot replicate records peer-to-peer! 
    If you want to achieve peer-to-peer replication between both db's (no restore would be required), in such case you'd need to open the db on Bob's side with Alice's /orbitdb/address 

### Svelte App Demonstrations & Components

- `node` [`scripts/svelte-backup-restore.js`] - A script creating an example Svelte app in a subdirectory which adds and demonstrates StorachaAuth.svelte and StorachaTest.svelte

## Video Demo

**Storacha Backup via Storacha Credentials Setup Demo**
[ðŸ“¹ Watch the demonstration video](docs/media/orbitdb-storacha-bridge-key-proof-credtials.mov)


## How It Works

1. **Extract Blocks** - Separates OrbitDB database into individual components (log entries, manifest, identities, access controls)
2. **Upload to Storacha** - Each block is uploaded separately to IPFS/Filecoin via Storacha
3. **Block Discovery** - Lists all files in Storacha space using Storacha SDK APIs
4. **CID Bridging** - Converts between Storacha CIDs (`bafkre*`) and OrbitDB CIDs (`zdpu*`)
5. **Reconstruct Database** - Reassembles blocks and opens database with original identity

## Testing

Ensure you have Storacha credentials in your `.env` file.
Use npm test commands to run various test suites including integration tests and verbose output.

### CAR Storage Tests

The `car-storage.test.js` suite provides comprehensive validation of the CAR (Content Addressable Archive) storage layer that enables persistent file-based storage for OrbitDB databases. The **Full OrbitDB Integration with Persistence** test demonstrates complete database lifecycle management: creating an OrbitDB instance with CAR storage, adding todo entries, persisting to CAR files, closing the database, reopening with a new OrbitDB instance, and verifying all data is perfectly recovered. This test validates that CAR storage can serve as a reliable persistence layer for OrbitDB's entry, heads, and index storage, ensuring data survives across application restarts.
